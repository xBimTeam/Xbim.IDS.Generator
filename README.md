# Xbim.IDS.Generator

A set of libraries to simplify generating complex IDS specifications from Information Requirements.

This library alows sets of IDS rules to be created automatically from code, and includes a number of time saving features such as:

1. Helpers for create IDS Facets for Entities, Properties, Attributes, Classifications etc
1. Building 'per-stage' IDS test files, from a single set of requirements
1. Including classification systems as enumerations. e.g. include checks for Uniclass, NRM1 etc
1. Making use of implicit IFC schema knowledge to ensure plug the lack of entity inheritance in IDS1
1. Sophisticated convention based naming checking. E.g. checking naming of Types/Objects based on their Type / predefined type
1. Automated numbering and grouping of rules into sections and sub-sections for clarity

It also includes a feature to generate test IFC models based on conventions to allow you to test your IDS is correct

There are two runnable projects:

 - _Xbim.IDS.Generator.Sample_ generates a generic set of IDS files for a notional client
 - _Xbim.IDS.Generator.Dfe_ generates IDS specification for the UK Department for Education's Framework Agreement EIR / PIS.  
This Dfe example includes a model Generator implementation.

The code for the Dfe project has been published with the agreement of the Dfe.
