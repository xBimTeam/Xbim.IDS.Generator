# Xbim.IDS.Generator.Dfe

This library implements the Dept for Education's IR standards as set out in the DfE's IMR - particularly by creating IDS files that help
assure IFC models meet the requirements of:

1. The PIS in FRM2021-DFE-XX-XX-T-X-0003-ProjectsInformationStandard-A-C02.docx
1. The EIRs alphanumeric requirements for IFC-SPF set out it FRM2021-DFE-XX-XX-L-X-0001-DfEsDetailedExchangeInformationRequirements-A-C02.xlsx

The project also builds two demo models according to Dfe conventions that can be used to test the IDS files.

Thanks to Ben Smith at DfE for agreeing to let us open source this software using the Dfe EIR requirements.
